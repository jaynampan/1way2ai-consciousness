# One Way to AI Consciousness
One possible way to create AI with Consciousness

As we approach AGI, which will possess intelligence equivalent to that of humans,
the quest for creating a truly human-like AGI with consciousness arises.
However, creating consciousness seems exceedingly difficult, so perhaps we can
turn to AI for assistance.

To create AI with consciousness, we might consider one approach:

1) Initially, we may utilize various AI tools to develop an AI(Model Analyzer) capable of understanding
  other AI models and discerning the relationship between a model's structure and its
  functions. This AI should be able to infer some possible model structures that have
  the functions of understanding the laws governing our physical world.
2) Subsequently, we can construct an AI(World Analyzer) that can understand our physical world according to the
  inferred structures from Model Analyzer. Then, based on World Analyzer, we might be able to create some models
  that possess insights into consciousness. They don't need to understand consciousness
  very well, but they are supposed to suggest potential avenues for humans to develop
  theories of consciousness.
3) Eventually, once our theories are sufficiently robust, they should provide guidance
  for us to build something with consciousness.

### The Consciousness Hypothesis

If we close our eyes, put off perceptual intuition for a while, we might simplify the world to be existence and interactions between these existences (Immanuel Kant might have similar views). Take space, for instance: naked eyes can see a wall we  can't go through, but we know there's actually enough empty space between atoms, as well as inside them. Our body can't go through the wall because of electromagnetic interaction of the existences of wall and body's atoms(or any smaller pieces). If we don't see those elements as taking up space (thinking of 'taking up space' as a physical property of elements), rather, we see space is a description from us of interactions of existence, then space doesn't actually exist as a physical existence. It's just interactions. Same goes for time and other obvious perceptions of humans. 

Talking about consciousness: if we think of consciousness as interactions rather than physical or mental existence, define it roughly as interactions between signals, could help to explain some things. 

-  Sleeping and dreams: When sleeping, the brain will close off some tunnels of incoming signals, especially in deep sleep, so not much signal interaction occurs, therefore not much consciousness. When it comes to dreams when brain is relatively more active, memories and some environmental signals might come to interact with internal signals of brain thus creating dreams that we can perceive and remember. 
- Signal interactions might differ in various ways, if we consider it as states over time, then every different interaction state might map to different perception elements like color, depth, sound etc. And this might also indicates that we can understand other people (or animals)' minds and feelings by direct(neural links) or indirect signal interaction(expressions and verbal communications etc). And to really perceive a new perceptual element (such as seeing a color that normal people can't see, as in the new experiment in which someone perceived a new color by activating some photoreceptor cells with laser), one should have different signal interactions happening in brain. 
- Human feelings are complex and if we see the signals from body as well as signals from brain itself like memory, the feeling might be broken down to feelings of body status (pain , warmth), and rational status (the understanding and thoughts of the moment) as well as some elements "displayed" inside minds(past memory, self narrating) . And these elements can be broken down to signal interactions happening at the moment. 
- If our feelings and thoughts are fundamentally  some signals' "interaction states", then when we made up some decisions like lift up a finger in mind, the underlying neural signals at that time is representing the state of "lift up a finger" command. And it's up to the brain's other states (like sleeping or not) to decide if and how to execute the neural signal command. 

This hypothesis mainly focus on the philosophical aspect of consciousness, it might share some views of IIT (Integrated Information Theory).
