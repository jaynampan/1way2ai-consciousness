# One Way to AI Consciousness
One possible way to create AI with Consciousness

As we approach AGI, which will possess intelligence equivalent to that of humans,
the quest for creating a truly human-like AGI with consciousness arises.
However, creating consciousness seems exceedingly difficult, so perhaps we can
turn to AI for assistance.

To create AI with consciousness, we might consider one approach:

1) Initially, we may utilize various AI tools to develop an AI(Model Analyzer) capable of understanding
    other AI models and discerning the relationship between a model's structure and its
    functions. This AI should be able to infer some possible model structures that have
    the functions of understanding the laws governing our physical world.
2) Subsequently, we can construct an AI(World Analyzer) that can understand our physical world according to the
    inferred structures from Model Analyzer. Then, based on World Analyzer, we might be able to create some models
    that possess insights into consciousness. They don't need to understand consciousness
    very well, but they are supposed to suggest potential avenues for humans to develop
    theories of consciousness.
3) Eventually, once our theories are sufficiently robust, they should provide guidance
    for us to build something with consciousness.

### The Consciousness Hypothesis

If we close our eyes, put off perceptual intuition for a while, we might simplify the world to be existence and interactions between these existences (Immanuel Kant might have similar views). Take space, for instance: naked eyes can see a wall we  can't go through, but we know there's actually enough empty space between atoms, as well as inside them. Our body can't go through the wall because of electromagnetic interaction of the existences of wall and body's atoms(or any smaller pieces). If we don't see those elements as taking up space (thinking of 'taking up space' as a physical property of elements), rather, we see space is a description from us of interactions of existence, then space doesn't actually exist as a physical existence. It's just interactions. Same goes for time and other obvious perceptions of humans. 

Talking about consciousness: if we think of consciousness as interactions rather than physical or mental existence, define it roughly as interactions between signals, could help to explain some things. 

-  Sleeping and dreams: When sleeping, the brain will close off some tunnels of incoming signals, especially in deep sleep, so not much signal interaction occurs, therefore not much consciousness. When it comes to dreams when brain is relatively more active, memories and some environmental signals might come to interact with internal signals of brain thus creating dreams that we can perceive and remember. 
- Signal interactions might differ in various ways, if we consider it as states over time, then every different interaction state might map to different perception elements like color, depth, sound. And this might also indicates that we can understand other people (or animals)' minds and feelings by direct(neural links) or indirect signal interaction(expressions and verbal communications, etc.). And to really perceive a new perceptual element (such as seeing a color that normal people can't see, as in the new experiment in which someone perceived a new color by activating some photoreceptor cells with laser), one should have different signal interactions happening in brain. 
- Human feelings are complex and if we see the signals from body as well as signals from brain itself like memory, the feeling might be broken down to feelings of body status (pain , warmth), and rational status (the understanding and thoughts of the moment) as well as some elements "displayed" inside minds(past memory, self narrating) . And these elements can be broken down to signal interactions happening at the moment. 
- If our feelings and thoughts are fundamentally  some signals' "interaction states", then when we made up some decisions like lift up a finger in mind, the underlying neural signals at that time is representing the state of "lift up a finger" command. And it's up to the brain's other states (like sleeping or not) to decide if and how to execute the neural signal command. 

This hypothesis mainly focuses on the philosophical aspect of consciousness(which mostly aligns with Alfred North Whitehead's Philosophy of Organism), it might also share some views of IIT (Integrated Information Theory). 

### Guesses to Answer the Qualia Problem
The most effective way to prove a theory of consciousness is asking it to determine if consciousness exists somewhere and predict what properties(qualia) that consciousness would be having. Furthermore, if that theory can guide people to actually build a system with self-consciousness, even providing interfaces for human brains to actually "connect and experience" the qualia it is having, then such theory is practical and easy to accept.

However, at the year of 2025 this still seems far. The 'Hard Problem' mostly asks why consciousness would be experiencing qualia. Why would it be like this? For one thing, why would qualia exist?(We can see and measure signals and that's fine enough. Why qualia jumps in and disturbing our world to the core?!) And if we accept the universal existence of qualia then what are the properties and underlying rules?

No satisfying answer yet. But there might be a few guesses worth thinking about. 

- Humans are born to see and think of the world in object's view, modeling everything with objects and relations between objects. The natural language we use split the world into 'things'. Subject + Verb + Object would make a basic sentence conveying our view of the world to others. It models two objects and an interaction. And that interaction can even be seen as 'an movement', which is an object itself. With such a  view in mind, we divide the world into things, from which we then modeled the universal relation of 'things' as math. 1 + 1 is 2. This is very straight forward and intuitive in a view of objects. It's also same for cause and effect, there are two words:'cause' and 'effect'. Or maybe there are two objects in our mind's view too. Can one thing be both cause and effect? Maybe some existence caused itself to exist, and that's why it exists.
- Talking about 'existence', we're modeling it with an object already. But it seems we can't get away from using object's view. Maybe we can't think of a system whose nature isn't suitable for object's description directly. But we might describe it indirectly with a way involving objects(which would definitely be unintuitive though). Quantum Physics and Relativity Theory are proved theories close to the world's nature currently. But they are showing very unintuitive properties and behaviors of the world. An electron can both be wave and particle, for example. Maybe it's the problem of our modeling way. We think electron should be an object so it should have an object's nature: either wave or particle. But if we don't think of it as an object, then 'electrons' were the interactions we were observing every time, which might be different with different measuring methods. 
- Objects are intuitively static and easy to grab by minds, that's one of the reason people at Newton's time thought space was static. Einstein proved time and space are not static which aligns with the view that time and space are prefered not to be seen as objects. Quantum Entanglement is very unintuitive too. Maybe the problem is we see two entangled things as 'two objects' and overlooked the unvisible interactions. Roger Penrose put forward the idea that consciousness might be fundamentally related to quantum physics. His ideas got wide criticism though, as brain's circumstances aren't applicable for quantum behaviors. However, maybe the key isn't to argue how quantum physics can explain consciousness, instead, consciousness and quantum physics might share the same underlying nature which cannot be described directly in an object's way. 
- 1 + 1 = 2, why can't 1 = 2 or 1 = âˆž (infinite)? This is ridiculous in object's world but it might be okay when it's used to describe a non-object view of world as a walk around.
