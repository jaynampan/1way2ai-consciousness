Some thoughts

The Godel's incompleteness theorem, along with other ideas, seem to point out that logic, or more generally, reason, has reached its boundaries. 

Instead of keeping going on the established paths for physics, or neuroscience and so on, I think we should going back in history, examining from the very beginning when humans start to percept the world differently from other animals, that is, making the chaos world clearer by thinking and framing it by language. 

The world itself is chaos apparently, and as humans develops a structure and build a world for themselves, something is gained and made clear, but therefore something else is lost and obscure. We tend to make a static, definite and clear image of the world, which can only be a partial portrait of the actual reality. 

So the question is, what to examine? and how?

For now I don't know. 



Consciousness is not science. 
Consciousness is not maths.
Consciousness is not words that's written. 
Consciousness is not voice that's spoken. 
Consciousness is not the image that's taken.
Consciousness is not public that people yearn.
Consciousness is being conscious. 

I assume that one day science and philosophy would go to the same crossing.
